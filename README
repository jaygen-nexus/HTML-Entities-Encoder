This HTML Entities Encoder is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to encode text into HTML entities. It provides an easy-to-use
interface for users to input their text and select the desired encoding type. The application then encodes the text into the selected HTML entity format and displays the
result. This tool is useful for web developers who need to encode text for use in webpages or other applications.
